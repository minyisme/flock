# Flock Assignments

This repository contains my two proglem solutions for Flock.


## Problem 1                  

The Bootstrap HTML Page problem. Finished the basics of the static HTML page.

Next steps:
- **Complete** Make complete/not complete checkbox
- **Dynamic Webpage** Make webpage dynamic

## Problem 2                  

The Python Calculator problem. Finished the basic calculator and created hard coded tests to run and user interface in command line.

Next steps:
- **Unittesting** Create unittests rather than hardcoded tests
- **Frontend Interaction** Connect to frontend for cleaner calculator interface
